# TicTacToeProlog
Prolog program of two artificial intelligences playing a game of tic tac toe.

You must download prolog in order to run:  https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable

In order to view code properly on VS Code, it is recommended you set the editor to prolog rather perl, as they both share the .pl file tag.
